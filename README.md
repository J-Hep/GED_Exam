The object pooling creates a queue and list, with the editor properties of tag, prefab and size. The values for position and size and rotation are grabbed from scene. 10 of these are then instantiated and deactivated. Once called to be reused in the pool it would activate and do what is required of from Ipooled and pooledScript.
As of writing the pooling is not activating. So theres 10 ducks instantiated but not active. Must be seen in editor.

Command I did not get to.

Duck logic for fun gameplay I did not get to.
